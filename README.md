Markdown Previewer Description:

I created a Markdown Previewer using React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, marked, and Prism.js. This web application allows users to write and instantly preview their Markdown-formatted text. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

Technologies I Used:

React: I employed this JavaScript library for building the user interface and managing components.
HTML and CSS: Standard web technologies were used to structure the page layout and style the user interface.
JavaScript: This language was crucial for implementing dynamic behavior and interactivity in the application.
marked: I utilized this library to parse and render Markdown content, enabling users to write in plain text while seeing a live, formatted preview.
Prism.js: This lightweight syntax highlighter improved the visual appeal and readability of code snippets within the Markdown content.
Components:

Editor Component: Users can input their Markdown content here. Any changes trigger real-time updates in the Previewer component.
Previewer Component: This section renders the parsed HTML output of the Markdown content. It dynamically updates as users type in the Editor.
Markdown Parsing and Rendering:

I relied on the marked library to convert user-entered Markdown content into HTML, handling the parsing and rendering.
Code Syntax Highlighting:

Integrated Prism.js into the Markdown Previewer to provide syntax highlighting for code snippets, enhancing the visual appeal and readability of the content.
Styling:

Custom CSS styling was applied to improve the visual appeal, including layout design, typography, and additional styling for a polished user interface.
Features:

Live Preview: Users experience real-time rendering of Markdown content as they type in the Editor, providing immediate feedback on the formatted output.
Code Syntax Highlighting: I implemented Prism.js to enhance the readability of code snippets through syntax highlighting.
External Links: I ensured that external links open in a new tab for a seamless browsing experience.
Deployment:

I designed the application to be easily deployed to GitHub Pages, allowing users to access and utilize the Markdown Previewer through a publicly accessible URL.
In summary, the Markdown Previewer I built offers users a dynamic and visually appealing platform for writing, previewing, and formatting Markdown content, with the added benefit of code syntax highlighting using Prism.js.
